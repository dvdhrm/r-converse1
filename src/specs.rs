//! Specification Constants and Definitions
//!
//! The `specs` module is a collection of modules that provide constants and
//! definitions from a wide set of specifications, standards, and RFCs.
//! Furthermore, a small set of helpers shared across the module is provided.
//!
//! The scope of the individual modules is limited to providing access to the
//! constants, structures, and layout defined in the individual specifications.
//! Not runtime implementation or operating-system adaptation is provided.
